What is Solutions Engineering
===

Solutions Engineering is a cross-functional role that primarily serves to bridge the gap between customer needs and the product teams. They work closely with many teams like sales, customers, development, marketing, design, and the product teams to find the intersection on a product that the customer wants and the development team can deliver. 

Solutions Engineers come from many different backgrounds, but they often require a good understanding of tech, especially in their specialized fields. 

As a Solutions Engineer, you can expect to primarily work with customers to figure out their business needs and eliminate glaring roadblocks to their intended outcome. You will then be working with your internal teams to translate those business needs and develop a possible solution with the allotted resources. This process will require many discovery calls to collect customer's requirements and ensure the POC and demos deliver on those requirements smoothly.

Is Solutions Engineering For You

Due to Solutions Engineering's multi-disciplinary nature, ensuring you're the right fit for the role can be challenging. If the following criteria describe you, then you might be a good candidate for becoming a Solutions Engineer:
* You enjoy client-facing work and working with customers
* You like doing discovery calls to collect customer requirements and developing a corresponding solution
* You have a solid technical understanding of technology, especially the tools or platforms you work with
* You're open to the idea of filling for different business and technical roles
* Solving problems and thinking of solutions is your forte
* Presentations and giving demos doesn't scare you

Nuances to note
===

Not all solutions engineering roles are created equally. Depending on where you work, you may be closer to the engineering side, or the business side. In some companies, these two are distinctions are actually celebrated, but may be something to note if you have a preference.
